	* vrpn_timecode_generator.dsp : DSP files have been modified to not do
		definitions of VRPN_NO_STREAMS and other constants directly,
		rather these are now set by editing vrpn_Configure.h.  Also,
		made projects compile in both debug and release versions.
	* vrpn_timecode_generator.cpp : Whitespace changes.  Guard by checking
		to see if INCLUDE_TIMECODE_SERVER is defined so that this
		file can be safely used during all compilations/links.
	* vrpn_timecode_generator.h : Same.
