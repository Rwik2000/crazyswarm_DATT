python_vrpn:
	VRPN wrapped in Python using Swig.  Works with Python 2.7.

python:
	Hand-written Python classes that work with Python 2.7 and 3.2.
	Compile the main library (ie.: root of VRPN) and the quat library.  Then, go to the "python" folder. Before making the binary, you have to define the "PYTHON_VERSION" environment variable to the version of python you want to compile it for (ie.: "3.2", "2.7" ...).  And you have to put the resulting vrpn.so shared library (found in $HW_OS/$PYTHON_VERSION) in the python module folder or in a path defined in the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

	The "essai_*.py" are simple python files that show you how to use this module (the single difference is a call to python3.2 or python2.7 interpreter).
