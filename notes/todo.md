TODO near
=========
- think about how we want to do real-time control
- think about how to do large-swarm position initialization
- characterize full system latency
- tune attitude controller w/ sinusoid and/or step inputs (done??)
- figure out why ellipse tracking is poor
- measure vicon delay with JTAG debugger
- look into delay compensation in EKF
- version-aware "flash all" script to avoid unneeded flashing
- what to do when interactive object disappears and it's suddenly fit to something else?

TODO far
=========
- navigation through obstacles with grouped team
- more automated method to compute ctr of mass from marker config (worth it??)
- increase object tracker robustness to outliers
- compute x-staggered positions to render text from a side view
- create "conductor wand" planner/controller
