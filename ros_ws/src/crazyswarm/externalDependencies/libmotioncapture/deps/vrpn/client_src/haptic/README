This directory contains test and example files for using a Phantom
force-feedback device with VRPN.  They were written by John Stone
at the NIH Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Bioinformatics at the
Beckman Institute at UIUC.

These programs are made to compile and run on an SGI.  The VRPN portions of
these programs should be portable across platforms, but the openGL portions
(if any) have not been ported to Windows.

This README is made by Russ Taylor, so hopefully it is accurate.

testvrpn.C:
	This opens the Phantom as a tracker, button, and forcedevice.
It prints out all tracker messages, button messages, amd force messages
(should there be force messages?)

glwin.[hc]:
	Helper functions to create openGL windows quickly and easily on Unix.

glvrpn.C:
	This opens and openGL window and displays the tracker as it moves
around (along with a line from the origin to the tracker).  It is a good
example of how to use a VRPN tracker with openGL.

phantom-field.C:
	Sends a forcefield to the Phantom when the button is held down.

phantom-plane.C:
	Sends a plane to the Phantom that the user can feel, quits when the
button is pressed.

phantom-wave.c:
	Sends a spatially-varying force field to the Phantom while the button
is held down.

smdvrpn.C:
	Simple molecular dynamics simulation using VRPN, graphics, and haptics.
